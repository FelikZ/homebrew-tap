# Personal Tap

This contains some tools that I need on my macOS machine, which aren't in the official Brew taps.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install lukasknuth/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap lukasknuth/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
