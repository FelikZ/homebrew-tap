# Personal Tap

This contains some tools that I need on my macOS machine, which aren't in the official Brew taps.

## How do I install these formulae?

SteelSeries Exactmouse Tool via Homebrew (tap / ask)
`brew install --cask "felikz/tap/steelseries-exactmouse-tool"`

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
